The dark side of the light chasers,Debbie Ford,Penguin,1998,,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1836890W,209,Self-Help,"The bestselling, beloved classic on how to go into the dark side of yourself to bring out the light -- now with new material. Debbie Ford believes that we each hold within us a trace of every human characteristic that exists, the capacity for every human emotion. We are born with the ability to express this entire spectrum of characteristics. But, Ford points out, our families and our society send us strong messages about which ones are good and bad. So when certain impulses arise, we deny them instead of confronting them, giving them a healthy voice, then letting them go. It is to these feelings that Ford turns our attention, these parts of our selves that don't fit the personae we have created for the rest of the world. She shows us the effects of living in the dark, of keeping all our supposedly unsavory impulses under wraps. We find ourselves disproportionately frustrated and angry at the selfishness of friends, the laziness of colleagues, the arrogance of siblings. When we are unable to reconcile similar impulses in ourselves, Ford explains, we waste our own energy judging others instead of empathizing. But most important, we deny ourselves the power and freedom of living authentically. Through the stories and exercises in The Dark Side of the Light Chasers, Debbie Ford shows us not only how to recognize our hidden emotions, but also how to find the gifts they offer us. This is for fans of Marianne Williamson, Neale Donald Walsch, and Deepak Chopra. The very impulses we most fear may be the key to what is lacking in our lives.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B2sTXsTO-UIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Knights of the crown,Roland Green,Boydell Press,1995,,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18167640W,686,History,"A significant contribution to the history of the political life and culture of the later medieval aristocracy. MAURICE KEEN Orders of lay knights - the most famous of which are those of the Garter and the Golden Fleece - were founded at some time between 1325 and 1470 in almost every kingdom of Western Christendom, and played an important part in the life of the court. Jonathan Boulton defines the ""monarchical"" orders as those with corporate statutes which attached the presidential office to the crown of the princely founder, or made it hereditary in his house. Modelled eitherdirectly or indirectly on the fictional society of the Round Table, they incorporated varying numbers of elements borrowed from the older religious orders of knighthood and from contemporary institutions. This study explores the nature and history of thirteen orders, and reveals them as not only an ingenious supplement to (or replacement for) the feudo-vassalic ties that still bound the leading members of the nobility to their sovereign, but also as the most important institutional embodiments of the secular ideals of chivalry that were at the heart of the international court culture of the age.

Approaching these models primarily through language, Orrin E. Klapp explores what they may suggest about Americans as a people. Rather than study people, the author describes abstract types named and embedded in popular language. These social types are important symbols; and a way to attack a symbol is by identifying its meaning in various contexts. He further argues that the language surrounding heroes, villains, and fools reveals a social structure. We may not escape being ascribed a type, but we do have a choice of type. Known more commonly as ""finding oneself,"" we can manipulate cues-with dress, facial expressions, style of life, or conspicuous public roles-to build an identity. This classic study has serious contemporary implications. For a public figure, an inevitable result of the typing process is the development of at least two selves, the public and the private. When the book originally appeared in 1962, the struggle to balance two images generally only plagued celebrities and politicians. Today, social media offers everyone the opportunity to develop an online persona. This volume will be of interest to sociologists as well as anyone who has a Facebook account.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hq00DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In the late 1990s, working closely with Lee's widow and referring to Lee's own copious notes, Little painstakingly reconstructed the movie according to Lee's vision. Here, readers get the inside story, firsthand from the man who made the discovery, remade the movie, and, in doing so, honored the best-loved and most highly respected martial artist in living history.

Norton & Company,2010,,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8165147W,989,Religion,"One hundred sermons that display the victorious, although sometimes painful, historical and spiritual pilgrimage of black people in America. A groundbreaking anthology, Preaching with Sacred Fire is a unique and powerful work. It captures the stunning diversity of the cultural and historical legacy of African American preaching more than three hundred years in the making. Each sermon, as editors Martha Simmons and Frank A. Thomas reveal, is a work of art and a lesson in unmatched rhetoric. The journey through this anthology—which includes selections from Jarena Lee, Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Gardner C. Taylor, Vashti McKenzie, and many others—offers a rare view of the unheralded role of the African American preacher in American history. The collection provides new insights into the underpinnings of the black fight for emancipation and the rise and growth of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. Sermons from the first decade of the twenty-first century point toward the future of African American preaching. Biographies of the preachers put their work in the cultural and homiletic context of their periods. The preachers of these sermons are men and women from a range of faiths, ancestries, and educational backgrounds. They draw on a vast and luminous landscape of poetic language, using metaphor, rhythm, and imagery to communicate with their congregations. What they all have in common is hope, resilience, and sacred fire. “Even during the most difficult and oppressive times,” Simmons and Thomas write in the preface, “the delivery, creativity, charisma, expressivity, fervor, forcefulness, passion, persuasiveness, poise, power, rhetoric, spirit, style, and vision of black preaching gave and gives hope to a community under siege.” This magnificent work beautifully renders the complexity, spiritual richness, and strength of African American life.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gj9D4cCE4fwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The lake of death,Jean Rabe,AnonymousChristian.Org,2004,,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL523414W,1603,Religion,"Christ Centered Universalism has been a Hope in First Christianity among the earliest orthodox Christians as testified even as late in St. Augustine of Hippo's infamous quote in that even he didn't call them as heretics but soft hearted Christians who did not deny Holy Scripture. A form of Christian Universalism by Origen of Alexandria may have been condemned by a later council. For protestants, please take note that both St. Augustine and that later council consists of members who Pray to Virgin Mary something which is absent from even Origen of Alexandria. Therefore, just because something is majority by later early Christianity it does not necessarily mean that it was First Christianity Doctrine. In light of this, we discuss various viewpoints, quotes by Church Fathers and Ancient Christian Writings in support of this Hope. Since the time lapse and loss of records to these First Christians being replaced by later Christianity is hard to trace or prove due to scarcity of evidences, nevertheless we endeavour to present as much as we can including some rarely known quotes within Christian Universalism Hopefuls itself. An example of a set of rare quotes which point to Christ Centered Universalism in this book which may not be popularly known is that by St. Hillary of Poitiers, the Champion of Trinity in the West and a set of interesting quotes likewise by St. Ignatius of Antioch who was a direct disciple if St. John the Apostle of Christ himself. We see traces of such an understanding in a quote by St. Justin Martyr toward the Wicked being made subject to obey God eventually as one child while St. Ireneous of Lyons has a few interesting quotes especially those that relate to the Concept of Ages/Aeons/Olam to come where in a particular instance, St. Ireneus clearly shows that the strongest phrase ""ages of Ages"" refers to the subset ""ages"" out of a larger set of ""Ages"" implying limitedness. Just like God of Abraham does not limit God to Abraham only, the phrase God's Glory to the Age/Aeon/Olam (singular) need not limit God's Glory to one Age only but may be highlighting it for that Age (unknown long time period). We do not need to teach it as a 100% certain doctrine but we may hope for it as the Bible Verses can also be understood consistently to present this Hope in some Way. One Day we will know and all things are possible with God Who Alone Decides.

The Dynize have unlocked the Landfall Godstone, and Michel Bravis is tasked with returning to Greenfire Depths to do whatever he can to prevent them from using its power; from sewing dissension among the enemy ranks to rallying the Palo population. Ben Styke's invasion of Dynize is curtailed when a storm scatters his fleet. Coming ashore with just twenty lancers, he is forced to rely on brains rather than brawn -- gaining new allies in a strange land on the cusp of its own internal violence. Bereft of her sorcery and physically and emotionally broken, Lady Vlora Flint now marches on Landfall at the head of an Adran army seeking vengeance against those who have conspired against her. While allied politicians seek to undo her from within, she faces insurmountable odds and Dynize's greatest general.

Sanctuary,William Faulkner,University of Arizona Press,1931,,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL82925W,208,History,"The death of twenty-one Salvadoran refugees in the Arizona desert in 1980 made many Americans aware for the first time that people were struggling—and dying—to find political asylum in the United States. Tucsonan Jim Corbett first encountered the problem while attempting to help a hitchhiking refugee. What came of that act of altruism was a movement that spread across the country, challenged the federal government, and brought the refugee problem to national awareness. Corbett first worked within the law to help refugees process applications for asylum, but the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service soon began a program of arrests; then he began to smuggle refugees from the Mexican border to the homes of citizens willing to provide shelter, making hundreds of trips over the next two years; finally he enlisted the support of the Tucson Ecumenical Council and persuaded John Fife, pastor of the Southside Presbyterian Church, to open that building as a refuge. When legal action against Corbett and the others seemed imminent, Southside became, on March 24, 1982, the first of two hundred churches in the country to declare itself a sanctuary. Convictions of the Heart takes readers inside the santuary movement to reveal its founders' motives and underlying beliefs, and inside the courtroom to describe the government's efforts to stop it. Although the book addresses many points of view, its primary focus is on the philosophy of Jim Corbett. Rooted in the nonviolence of Gandhi, the Society of Friends, and Martin Luther King, Corbett's beliefs challenged individuals and communities of faith across the country to examine the strength of their commitment to the needs and rights of others.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0p9EEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Star Wars - Thrawn - Alliances,Timothy Zahn,Random House Worlds,2018,,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19657298W,419,Fiction,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Grand Admiral Thrawn and Darth Vader team up against a threat to the Empire in this thrilling novel from bestselling author Timothy Zahn. “I have sensed a disturbance in the Force.” Ominous words under any circumstances, but all the more so when uttered by Emperor Palpatine. On Batuu, at the edge of the Unknown Regions, a threat to the Empire is taking root—its existence little more than a glimmer, its consequences as yet unknowable. But it is troubling enough to the Imperial leader to warrant investigation by his most powerful agents: ruthless enforcer Lord Vader and brilliant strategist Grand Admiral Thrawn. Fierce rivals for the Emperor’s favor and outspoken adversaries on Imperial affairs—including the Death Star project—the formidable pair seem unlikely partners for such a crucial mission. But the Emperor knows it’s not the first time Vader and Thrawn have joined forces. And there’s more behind his royal command than either man suspects. In what seems like a lifetime ago, General Anakin Skywalker of the Galactic Republic and Commander Mitth’raw’nuruodo, officer of the Chiss Ascendancy, crossed paths for the first time. One on a desperate personal quest, the other with motives unknown . . . and undisclosed. But facing a gauntlet of dangers on a far-flung world, they forged an uneasy alliance—neither remotely aware of what his future held in store. Now, thrust together once more, they find themselves bound again for the planet where they once fought side by side. There they will be doubly challenged—by a test of their allegiance to the Empire . . . and by an enemy that threatens even their combined might. Praise for Thrawn: Alliances “It’s a science fiction beach read in the best way, brisk and amusing, with some cool additions to the Star Wars galaxy.”—Den of Geek “Like all of Zahn’s novels set in a galaxy far, far away, it’s an essential read for anyone looking for an artistically done adventure.”—CNET",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=keA4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
